## Oak Service Overview

Oak is a storage system provided by the Stanford Research Computing Center
([SRCC](https://srcc.stanford.edu/)) and available to all researchers at Stanford University.
It is based on [Lustre](http://lustre.org), a distributed parallel file system with wide scalability,
both in performance and storage capacity.

Oak is particularly well suited to store large group-shared datasets, curated output of HPC job campaigns and archives at a
very affordable price. Oak is available from multi-protocol gateways (like Globus, SFTP and SMB) and is
mounted on the Sherlock HPC cluster. Based on off-the-shelf components and open source software, it can easily
grow in order to accommodate the research projectsâ€™ increasing storage requirements, up to tens of petabytes.

Two flavors of the storage service are available (charged monthly):

|  Service flavor     | Service description | Service price |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **10TB FILESPACE**  | Disk space in increments of **10 TB and 1.5 million inodes**[^1]. | $42.95 per 10TB / month<br> <small>*or $0.004295/GB/month*</small> |
| **250TB FILESPACE** | Disk space in increments of **250 TB and 37.5 million inodes**[^1]. | $550 per 250TB / month<br> <small>*or $0.0022/GB/month*</small> |

[^1]: inodes are filesystem objects like files and directories

Oak storage is readily available from [Sherlock](http://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/), [SCG](https://login.scg.stanford.edu/) and [XStream](http://xstream.stanford.edu/) HPC clusters,
but also from multi-protocol gateways (Globus, SFTP, NFSv4, SMB/CIFS...). Shared Globus and SFTP gateways are available for all, but personalized gateway service, like SMB or NFS,
will incur additional costs to the PI:

|  Service flavor | Service description | Service price |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Gateway**     | Access to and management of gateway to Oak Storage | $71 / month per gateway<br> |

## Oak group space

 *  There are only group/project spaces on Oak (similar to how /home/groups or /scratch/groups work on Sherlock).
 *  When a group directory is created on Oak, we use the PI/faculty SUNet ID as the group name (eg. /oak/stanford/groups/SUNetID/).
 *  Or, alternatively, a project directory can be created under /oak/stanford/projects/.
 *  File system group quotas are used to limit the amount of file system space group/project can use.
 *  Each group is provided with a personal dashboard that provides information about available disk space (quota) and usage.


## Managing users

 *  The PI provides an initial list of SUNet IDs having access to the new group or project shared directory on Oak.
 *  The PI gets access to a [Stanford Workgroup](https://workgroup.stanford.edu) to manage authorized users (please be aware that changes made in Workgroup Manager may take up to 4 hours to be propagated to Oak).
 *  Members of the workgroup can then organize files as they desire in the group/project directory (POSIX ACLs are supported).
